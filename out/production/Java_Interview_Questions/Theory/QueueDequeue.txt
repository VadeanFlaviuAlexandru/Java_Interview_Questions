queue = FIFO (insertion of elements takes place from the rear end and deletion at front end)
cant use iterators to access elements

dequeue = NOT FIFO or LIFO (it uses dynamic array for its implementation, it can contract and
 expand from both ends)
it is a sequence container, so insertion/deletion of elements takes place from both the ends.
elements can easily be accessed using iterators
