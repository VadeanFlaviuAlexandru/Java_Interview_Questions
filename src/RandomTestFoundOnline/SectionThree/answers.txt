        before approving the withdrawal request.
       Physical Security: ATMs are often located in secure areas and equipped with
        surveillance cameras to deter criminal activities and ensure user safety.
       Transaction Receipt: Providing a receipt allows users to verify the transaction
        details and reconcile their account statements, enhancing transparency and security.
       Timeout and Session Termination: To prevent unauthorized access, ATMs typically have
        session timeout mechanisms that automatically log out users after a period of inactivity.
