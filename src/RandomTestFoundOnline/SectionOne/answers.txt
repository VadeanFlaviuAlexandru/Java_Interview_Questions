1. Polymorphism means "many forms" and refers to the ability of objects to respond
   differently to the same message or method invocation. It allows objects of different classes
   to be treated as objects of a common superclass. There are two types of polymorphism:
   compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).
   Polymorphism enhances the flexibility and reusability of code by enabling the use of a single
   interface to represent different data types or objects.

2. Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide
    a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters, and same return type as a method in
    its superclass, it is said to override the method of the superclass.

3. 'super' keyword refer to the superclass of the current object or to call methods and
    constructors of the superclass.

4. 'public static void main(String args[])' is the signature of the entry point method
    for a Java program.
