Multithreading in Java allows your program to execute multiple threads concurrently,
enabling it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Here's a brief explanation:

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It represents an independent path
of execution in your program. Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process.
It can improve the performance and responsiveness of your program by allowing it to execute
multiple tasks simultaneously. It's particularly useful for tasks such as handling user interactions,
performing background tasks, or parallelizing computations.

In Java, multithreading is implemented using the `Thread` class or the `Runnable` interface. You can create a new thread
by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method, or by implementing the `Runnable` interface
and passing it to a `Thread` object. Once a thread is created, you can start it by calling its `start()` method.
Java also provides synchronization mechanisms, such as `synchronized` blocks and locks, to coordinate access
to shared resources among multiple threads and prevent data corruption or race conditions.

Here's a simple example of creating and starting a new thread in Java:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and start a new thread
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We create a new class `MyThread` that extends the `Thread` class and overrides its `run()` method.
- Inside the `run()` method, we specify the code to be executed by the thread.
- In the `main()` method, we create an instance of `MyThread` and start it by calling its `start()` method.
