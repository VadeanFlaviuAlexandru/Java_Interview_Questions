Java Map is a collection interface that provides a way
 to store data in a key-value format.
 (used to quickly access data stored in the collection by its unique key,
 rather than iterating through a list to find the desired value)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------HashMap

One of the most commonly used Map classes is HashMap.
This class provides a ❗fast and efficient way❗ to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
It's also worth noting that ❗HashMap does not guarantee the order of its elements.❗

(❗it allows for null values and null keys❗)

❗entrySet() method in Java. It is used to create and then return a 'set'
of the same elements that are already present in the HashMap. It can be used with a loop
to iterate over all the entries of a HashMap.❗

-------------------------------------------------------------------------TreeMap

Another commonly used Map class is TreeMap. This class is similar to HashMap,
but ❗it sorts its elements based on their keys.❗ This can be useful in situations
where you need to iterate over the elements in a specific order.

(❗it allows for null values but not for null keys❗)
(❗it can be slower than other Map classes❗)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------LinkedHashMap

Finally, there's LinkedHashMap. This class is similar to HashMap, but it maintains
the ❗order in which its elements were inserted.❗ This can be useful in situations where
you need to preserve the order of your data.

(❗it allows for null values and null keys❗)
