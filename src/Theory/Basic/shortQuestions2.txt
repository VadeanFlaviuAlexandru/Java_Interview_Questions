-> What is a Memory Leak ?
-> How can a memory leak appear in garbage collected language ?
-> Is it even possible ?

a memory leak is when a program fails to release allocated memory.
it is possible a memory leak can appear when the garbage collector might not be able to reclaim
the memory associated with the object. this happens when we store the objects in long-lived
data structures, such as collections (List,Set,Queue,..) and caches.
it can also happen when a group of objects reference each other
it can also be when file handles, network/db connections are not released explicitly
it can also happen when class loaders are not released properly

-> what is JVM and JRE?

the JVM is a crucial component for JRE. JRE is a package that is needed to run Java Apps.
JVM is a layer between the compiled java bytecode and the hardware and OS.

-> what is a class loader?

a part of JRE that dynamically loads java classes into the JVM

-> What is a primitive type in Java ? What are the main primitive types ?

we have primite data types as int, long, double and non-primitive data types such as Arrays,
String and Classes.

-> What is auto-boxing/unboxing ?

auto-boxing is when you convert primitive types o their corresponding wrapper classes.

-> What is implicit casting ? but explicit casting ?

implicit casting is known as widening, when a data type with a smaller range is converted
to a data type with a larger range/size. explicit is the opposite and you use the cast operator:
from 'double value = 42.65' to 'int smallervalue = (int) value'

-> When developing an e-commerce site, what is the recommended type to use for the price
if performance is not an issue. What if performance is an issue ?

In practice, if precision is crucial (e.g., in financial calculations), BigDecimal is recommended.
If performance is a higher priority, and small rounding errors are acceptable, you might choose
to use double. However, keep in mind that double may introduce small rounding errors in decimal
calculations.
