    Pre-order traversal: In pre-order traversal, the root node is visited first,
                            then its left and right sub-trees are visited.

                            so: root -> left -> right


    In-order traversal: In in-order traversal, the left sub-tree is visited first,
                            then the root node, and finally the right sub-tree.

                            so: left -> root -> right


    Post-order traversal: In post-order traversal, the left and right sub-trees are visited
                            first, and then the root node is visited last.

                            so: left -> right -> root
