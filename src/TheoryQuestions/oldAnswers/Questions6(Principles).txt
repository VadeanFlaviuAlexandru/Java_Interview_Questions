1. What does “beautiful code “ mean to you?

Beautiful code typically refers to code that exhibits certain characteristics or qualities that
make it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

In addition to "KISS" (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and "YAGNI" (You Aren't Gonna Need It),
there are several other principles and guidelines that are commonly referenced in
software development to promote good design, maintainability, and efficiency.
Here are a few of them:

    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): The DRY principle states that every piece of knowledge or
    logic in a system should have a single, unambiguous representation. Duplication of code
    leads to maintenance difficulties, increased risk of bugs, and inconsistency. Instead,
    reusable components, functions, or abstractions should be created to avoid redundancy.

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The SRP states that a class or module should have
    only one reason to change. It promotes high cohesion by ensuring that each component of
    the system has a single responsibility or concern, making the code easier to understand,
    maintain, and test.

    Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules,
    functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages
    designing systems that can be easily extended with new functionality without modifying
    existing code, typically through the use of inheritance, composition, or dependency injection.

    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be
    replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
    In other words, derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without
    altering the desired behavior of the system.

    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The ISP states that clients should not be forced to
    depend on interfaces they don't use. It promotes the creation of small, cohesive interfaces
    tailored to specific client needs, rather than large, monolithic interfaces that encompass
    unrelated functionality.

    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The DIP states that high-level modules should not
    depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. It promotes loose
    coupling between components by inverting the traditional dependency hierarchy, allowing
    for more flexible and modular designs.

    Composition Over Inheritance: This principle suggests favoring composition (building
    complex objects by combining simpler ones) over inheritance (creating new classes by
    extending existing ones). Composition often leads to more flexible, reusable, and
    maintainable designs by avoiding the limitations and complexities of inheritance.

    Law of Demeter (LoD) or Principle of Least Knowledge: The LoD states that a module
    should only have knowledge of its immediate dependencies and should not know about
    the internal details of objects it interacts with indirectly. It promotes loose
    coupling and encapsulation by limiting the scope of interactions between modules.

Let's explain again each of the SOLID principles:

SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle

States that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have
only one responsibility or encapsulate only one aspect of the functionality within the
software system. In other words, a class should be responsible for only one part of the
software's behavior.
By adhering to SRP, classes become more focused and less likely to undergo changes due to unrelated
requirements. This improves maintainability, readability, and testability of the codebase.
Additionally, it promotes better separation of concerns, making the code easier to understand
and modify.
**Example:**
Consider a class `Employee` that handles both employee information and payroll calculations.
By applying SRP, we could split this class into `EmployeeInformation` and `PayrollCalculator`,
each responsible for its own distinct functionality.

OCP: The Open/Closed Principle

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should
be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a module should
be extendable without modifying its source code.
By designing software modules that are open for extension, developers can add new functionality
without modifying existing code, thus reducing the risk of introducing bugs in the existing
codebase. This principle encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism to achieve
flexibility and modularity in software design.
**Example:**
Instead of directly modifying existing sorting algorithms, we can extend their behavior by
creating new sorting classes that implement a common interface. This allows us to add new sorting
algorithms without changing the existing code that relies on them.

LSP: The Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with
objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words,
a subclass should be substitutable for its superclass without changing the desirable properties
of the program. By adhering to LSP, developers ensure that inheritance hierarchies maintain
behavioral compatibility and do not introduce unexpected behavior when substituting subclasses
for their superclasses. This principle promotes polymorphism and facilitates code reuse.
**Example:**
Consider a class hierarchy where `Rectangle` is a superclass of `Square`. If a method expects a
`Rectangle` object, according to LSP, it should be able to work correctly with a `Square`
object as well, without making any assumptions about the specific type.

ISP: The Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on
interfaces they do not use. In other words, interfaces should be tailored to the specific needs
of clients to avoid unnecessary dependencies and coupling. By following ISP, developers can design
cohesive and focused interfaces that are easier to understand, implement, and maintain. This
principle helps prevent the "interface pollution" problem, where clients are burdened with
methods they don't need, leading to unnecessary dependencies and potential code bloat.
**Example:**
Consider an interface `Machine` with methods for both printing and scanning. If a client only
needs printing functionality, forcing it to depend on the `Machine` interface violates ISP.
Instead, separate interfaces like `Printer` and `Scanner` should be provided to cater to the
specific needs of clients.

DIP: The Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level
modules; both should depend on abstractions. Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on
details; details should depend on abstractions. By following DIP, developers decouple components
within a system and promote the use of abstractions to reduce dependencies and improve flexibility.
This principle facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and evolution of software systems by
minimizing the impact of changes in one component on other components.
**Example:**
Instead of directly instantiating and using concrete implementations of dependencies within a class,
dependencies should be abstracted through interfaces or abstract classes. This allows for easier
substitution of dependencies and promotes loose coupling between components.

Let's delve into:

REP: The Reuse/Release Equivalency Principle

The Reuse/Release Equivalency Principle (REP) states that the granularity of reuse is the same as
the granularity of release. In other words, a software component (module, class, etc.) that is
released together should also be reused together. Conversely, components that are reused together
should be released together. REP emphasizes the importance of aligning the scope of software
release with the scope of software reuse. When components are released together, it implies that
they are versioned, tested, and maintained together, ensuring compatibility and consistency.
Similarly, when components are reused together, it implies that they are functionally related
and should evolve together to maintain compatibility.
**Example:**
Consider a library containing utility functions for string manipulation and file I/O operations.
If this library is released as a single package, developers who reuse it can expect all the
functions to be compatible and tested together. Conversely, if the library is split into
separate packages for string manipulation and file I/O, developers may encounter compatibility
issues if they rely on functions from both packages but they are not released together.

CCP: The Common Closure Principle

The Common Closure Principle (CCP) states that classes that change together should be grouped
together. It suggests that classes should be cohesive and encapsulate functionality that changes
for the same reasons at the same time. Classes with common closure share common reasons for
change and are less likely to be affected by changes in other classes. CCP promotes high cohesion
within classes by ensuring that related functionalities are encapsulated together. When classes
exhibit common closure, changes that affect one class are less likely to impact other classes,
leading to better maintainability and reduced risk of introducing bugs.
**Example:**
Consider a banking application with classes for account management, transaction processing,
and user authentication. If changes to the authentication mechanism often require modifications
to the user authentication class, but not to other classes, then the user authentication class
exhibits common closure. In contrast, if changes to authentication also necessitate modifications
to transaction processing or account management classes, then the classes do not exhibit common
closure.

CRP: The Common Reuse Principle

The Common Reuse Principle (CRP) states that classes that are used together should be grouped
together. It suggests that classes that are frequently used together should be encapsulated
within the same module or component to facilitate reuse. CRP promotes encapsulating related
functionality within the same module or component to facilitate reuse and minimize dependencies.
By grouping classes that are commonly reused together, developers can create cohesive and
self-contained modules that are easier to understand, maintain, and reuse across different
parts of the system.
**Example:**
In a web application, classes responsible for handling user authentication, session management,
and access control are frequently used together. Following CRP, these classes should be grouped
together within the same module or package to facilitate reuse and ensure that changes to one
component do not affect the others unnecessarily.
