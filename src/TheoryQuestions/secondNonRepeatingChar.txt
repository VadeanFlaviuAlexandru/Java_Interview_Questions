Suppose you read an infinite sequence of characters from a stream, one at a time, like so:
G, X, A, C, X, F, G… At some later point in time (potentially much later), someone asks you:
what was the 2nd character that didn’t repeat in the stream? Write a small program to handle
reading the characters and be able to answer this question.

A HashMap is a reasonable approach and is efficient for most cases.
To be more memory efficient, we can use a linkedhashmap with access order.
If we have a small character sequence for example, an array[256] based approach would be more
    performance-friendly. if we want

If the stream is not finite and keeps coming indefinitely, you need to implement a loop that reads
characters from the input stream in real-time or at regular intervals.
